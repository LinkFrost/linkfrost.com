Hey! Welcome to the first of my blog posts. After tinkering with styles and a format for a long time, I think I've finally gotten my blog system in order.

## How does this work?

The blog portion of this site is statically generated, meaning this shoud all be pretty fast to load on most devices and browsers. I'm using two npm libraries to aid with this structure, _marked_ and _gray-matter_. This essentially allows me to keep a folder of Markdown files (which you can find under the "posts" folder on this website's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LinkFrost/linkfrost.com)) that I can use for writing blog posts. It's a little limiting considering I can't get too experimental with layouts and CSS between different blog post pages, as all the Markdown styling has to be done from one source. I have some ideas around this, but I'll get to those later if I feel like I need them.

## So what's this all about?

Now that I have the basic structure set for creating blog posts, I hope to start doing things like discussing new things I'm learning in the field of Computer Science, tutorials, but I'm also really excited to try my hand at writing music reviews, and if my time permits, maybe things on games, movies, and comics.

## What's next for this site?

Things I need to still add include:

- Filtering on the main /blog page for different post types
- Sorting on the main /blog page by latest posts (current default), oldest, most popular, etc
- Search functionality
